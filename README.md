# cnc-as-service
Problem: Many small businesses in rural areas can't afford expensive CNC machines, limiting their ability to innovate and compete. 
Solution: I've developed a "CNC as a Service" platform to solve this. It's a game-changer for entrepreneurs and designers.

How it works:

Upload your file and project details.

Find the nearest workshop with the right machine.

Book a slot for the service.

Track your product in real-time.

Get it delivered to your door.

This platform helps small businesses improve quality and compete on a level playing field. It's about empowering growth through access to advanced technology.
